# 1. Prompt Configuration
#
########

  # if you install git via homebrew, or install the bash autocompletion via homebrew, you get __git_ps1 which you can use in the PS1
  # to display the git branch.  it's supposedly a bit faster and cleaner than manually parsing through sed. i dont' know if you care 
  # enough to change it

  # This function is called in your prompt to output your active git branch.
  function parse_git_branch {
    git branch --no-color 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/ (\1)/'
  }

  # This function builds your prompt. It is called below
  function prompt {
    # Define some local colors
    local   RED="\[\033[0;31m\]" # This syntax is some weird bash color stuff
    local   LIGHT_RED="\[\033[1;31m\]" # only master neckbears understand.
    local   CHAR="♥" # Not even I understand it, my neckbeard isn't there yet.
    local   BLUE="\[\e[0;49;34m\]" # Google snippets if you want other prompt setups

    # ♥ ☆ - Keeping some cool ASCII Characters for reference

    # Here is where we actually export the PS1 Variable which stores the text for your prompt
    export PS1="\[\e]2;\u@\h\a[\[\e[37;44;1m\]\t\[\e[0m\]]$RED\$(parse_git_branch) \[\e[32m\]\W\[\e[0m\]\n\[\e[0;31m\]$BLUE//$RED $CHAR \[\e[0m\]"
      PS2='> '
      PS4='+ ' 
    }

  # Finally call the function and our prompt is all pretty
  prompt

  # For more prompt coolness, check out Halloween Bash:
  # http://xta.github.io/HalloweenBash/

  # If you break your prompt, just delete the last thing you did.
  # And that's why it's good to keep your dotfiles in git too.

#
# 2. Environmental Variables & Paths
#
########
  # Library Paths
  # These variables tell your shell where they can find certain
  # required libraries so other programs can reliably call the variable name
  # instead of a hardcoded path.

    # NODE_PATH
    # Node Path from Homebrew, comment out if using OSX, not needed in Linux
    #export NODE_PATH="/usr/local/lib/node_modules:$NODE_PATH"

    # Those NODE & Python Paths won't break anything even if you
    # don't have NODE or Python installed. Eventually you will and
    # then you don't have to update your bash_profile

  # Configurations

    # GIT_MERGE_AUTO_EDIT
    # This variable configures git to not require a message when you merge.
    # Comment out if you prefer git not to warn you whenever you merge
    # I prefer to always be warned when this occurs, because I often make stupid muscle memory mistakes
    #export GIT_MERGE_AUTOEDIT='no'

    # Editors
    # Here you define default editors to be used by the OS whenever you ask to open a file
    # The -w flag tells your shell to wait until sublime exits
    #export VISUAL="subl -w"
    #export SVN_EDITOR="subl -w"
    #export GIT_EDITOR="subl -w"
    #export EDITOR="subl -w"

  # Paths

    # The USR_PATHS variable will just store all relevant /usr paths for easier usage
    # Each path is seperate via a : and we always use absolute paths.

    # TODO: This needs to be checked for compatibility with linux, this came originally from my macOS bash
    # A bit about the /usr directory
    # The /usr directory is a convention from linux that creates a common place to put
    # files and executables that the entire system needs access too. It tries to be user
    # independent, so whichever user is logged in should have permissions to the /usr directory.
    # We call that /usr/local. Within /usr/local, there is a bin directory for actually
    # storing the binaries (programs) that our system would want.
    # Also, Homebrew adopts this convetion so things installed via Homebrew
    # get symlinked into /usr/local
    #export USR_PATHS="/usr/local:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin"

    # Hint: You can interpolate a variable into a string by using the $VARIABLE notation as below.

    # We build our final PATH by combining the variables defined above
    # along with any previous values in the PATH variable.

    # Our PATH variable is special and very important. Whenever we type a command into our shell,
    # it will try to find that command within a directory that is defined in our PATH.
    # Read http://blog.seldomatt.com/blog/2012/10/08/bash-and-the-one-true-path/ for more on that.
    #export PATH="$USR_PATHS:$PATH"

    # If you go into your shell and type: echo $PATH you will see the output of your current path.
    # For example, mine is:
    # /Users/avi/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p392/bin:/Users/avi/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p392@global/bin:/Users/avi/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p392/bin:/Users/avi/.rvm/bin:/usr/local:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/mysql/bin:/usr/local/share/python:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:

# 3. Helper Functions
#
########

# A function to CD into the desktop from anywhere
# so you just type desktop.
# HINT: It uses the built in USER variable to know your OS X username

# USE: desktop
#      desktop subfolder
function desktop {
  cd /Users/$USER/Desktop/$@
}

# A function to easily grep for a matching process
# USE: psg postgres
function psg {
  FIRST=`echo $1 | sed -e 's/^\(.\).*/\1/'`
  REST=`echo $1 | sed -e 's/^.\(.*\)/\1/'`
  ps aux | grep "[$FIRST]$REST"
}

# A function to extract correctly any archive based on extension
# I ALWAYS forget how to properly extract all the different kinds of archives
# that exist from the command line, so this is a nice helper to have.
# USE: extract imazip.zip
#      extract imatar.tar
function extract () {
    if [ -f $1 ] ; then
        case $1 in
            *.tar.bz2)  tar xjf $1      ;;
            *.tar.gz)   tar xzf $1      ;;
            *.bz2)      bunzip2 $1      ;;
            *.rar)      rar x $1        ;;
            *.gz)       gunzip $1       ;;
            *.tar)      tar xf $1       ;;
            *.tbz2)     tar xjf $1      ;;
            *.tgz)      tar xzf $1      ;;
            *.zip)      unzip $1        ;;
            *.Z)        uncompress $1   ;;
            *)          echo "'$1' cannot be extracted via extract()" ;;
        esac
    else
        echo "'$1' is not a valid file"
    fi
