# MyBASH

This is my repository to store my personal bash configurations. They are divided into different files so it is easier to maintain different versions. They are also stored in ~/SHELL/mybash/ so that git can work properly, and they are sourced in .bash_profile and .bashrc by single line references so that they reference whatever version I'd like. There will be a write up for my blog for how I set this config up, how I use it, and why coming shortly, and its contents will be here and on my [personal site/blog](http://thepatternbuffer.com).
